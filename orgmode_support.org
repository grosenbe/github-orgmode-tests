* Syntax Examples

** *Simple* /text/ _formatting_

- *bold*
- /italic/
- _underline_
- +strike through+
- =code=
- ~commands~

: small example

Within links:

[[http://orgmode.org][This *is* an /example/ of _some_ syntax +highlighting+ within =links= and ~such~.]]

[[https://gnu.org][~gnu~]]

-----

Five or more dashes produce a horizontal line.

** Lists and Checkboxes

simple list:
- Org mode
- Lists
- [ ] unchecked checkbox
- [X] checked checkbox
- [-] undecided checkbox (=C-u C-u C-c C-c=)

enumerate:
1. Emacs
2. Org-mode
3. Lists

mixed with checkboxes:

- Clean out garage
  1. [ ] get stuff out
     - [X] be careful with that axe, Eugene
  2. [X] get rid of old stuff
     - sell on the Internet?
     - try to use rubbish as birthday presents for family
  3. [ ] repaint garage
  4. [ ] put stuff back in

** Blocks

An EXAMPLE block is rendered "as is", keeping line breaks and not
interpreting content:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
An example in an EXAMPLE block.
Second line within this block.

This *is* an /example/ of _some_ syntax +highlighting+ within =links= and ~such~.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Content within a QUOTE block may get different line breaks when
exported/renderd and interprets text formatting:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An example in an QUOTE block.
Second line within this block.

This *is* an /example/ of _some_ syntax +highlighting+ within =links= and ~such~.
#+END_QUOTE

SRC blocks contain source code snippets. Text formatting is ignored,
line breaks preserved.

A Python source code example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  def my_test(myvar: str = 'foo bar'):
      """
      This is an example function.

      @type  myvar: str = 'foo bar': number
      @param myvar: str = 'foo bar': FIXXME
      """

      mynewvar: str = myvar + ' additional content'
      return mynewvar

  print("Hello " + my_text('Europe!'))
#+END_SRC

A shell script example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
echo "Hello Europe!"
FOO="foo bar"
echo "A test with ${FOO}"
pwd
#+END_SRC

** Comments

Comment  lines contain  content which  is not  visible in  any derived
document such as a PDF document or a web view.

hash space:

# This is a comment

space hash space:

 # This is a comment

space space hash space:

  # This is a comment

-----------

Comment block:

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
This is a multi line comment block.
This is the second line.

This is the second paragraph.

This *is* an /example/ of _some_ syntax +highlighting+ within =links= and ~such~.
#+END_COMMENT
